# dnsFIND
dnsFIND performs DNS and WHOIS lookups for a given domain name. It then uses the dns.resolver and whois Python libraries to retrieve DNS and WHOIS information, respectively, and the requests and simplekml libraries to retrieve the location of IP addresses and generate a KML file with the locations of IP addresses found in DNS A records.
